        After working in warehouse for a couple of years I decided to pursue my
        passion for programming. I enrolled in a 2-year
        <span className="font-bold"> Vocational Education </span> in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-stack development</span> and
        graduated this spring.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          React and Next.js with TypeScript, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL.
        </span>{" "}
        I am also familiar with Dart & Flutter. I am always looking to learn new
        technologies. I am currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">junior position</span> as a software
        developer, java developer, web developer or app developer for mobile
        devices. I am intrested in both remote and on-site work. I am currently
